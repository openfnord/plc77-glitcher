This is the last revision that I will make to this file.

Revisons:
I have increased the length of the circuit board by 1/2 inch 
to allow for a less cluttered layout.

I moved the surface mount resistors nearer to the thru hole types.

I also (the Most Significant change) modified the oscilator circuit
to add a resistor(R6) and change the value of R1, making the output
wave form much better.

Parts list and Notes

1 ISO card socket of your choosing
1 9 pin female D sum min connector (X2)
2 1n4004 diodes (D2, D3)
2 1n914 or 1n4148 diodes (D4, D5)
1 red/dreen led (two lead type) (D1)
1 90S2313p-10 atmel processor (IC1)programmed with bl.hex
1 MAX232 (IC3)
1 74HC00 (IC4) 
1 7405 (IC2)
1 7805T (U1)
1 bridge rectifyer (B1)
2 .1uf cap (C1, C3)
2 27pf cap (C4, C5)
1 35uf to 100 uf Cap 16v min (C2)
4 10 uf 16v cap (C6, C8, C9, C10)
2 430 to 475 ohm resister(R3 or R3a,R4 or R4a)
1 1 Meg ohm resister (R1 or R1a)
1 33ohm 1/2 watt resister (R2)
1 1K to 2.2K resister (R5 or R5a)
1 2.2K resister (R6 or R6a)
1 3.57595 mhz Crystal (Q1)

This programmer is intended to be used as a standalone Phoenix type iso programmer with the ability to use the Atmel Chip from the Simpleboot product to allow operation with H cards that have suffered the Black Sunday Ecm.

If non Glitching operation is desired, simply do not install the Atmel IC and put a jumper wire from pin 12 to 13 of that atmels socket.

It is designed to be built on a single sided pcb but there are a few jumpers that must be installed.

The original one used surface mounted resister and i have added provisions for thru hole parts,
use one or the other not both!

I recommend that all the ICs be socketed.

If you wish to power the programmer from the PC, use a pc power extension from Radio Shack and cut off one of the male plugs and attach the red wire to the pad which goes to the diode and the black wires to the two center pads, the yellow wire it not used but may be soldered to the pad provided.

If powered from PC, the bridge, regulator and associated parts may be removed.

I designed the layout to fit the four inch wide opening typical of the diskette drive in a PC.
I mounted a programer on the plastic type adapter used to mount a diskette drive in a 5 1/4 inch bay of a PC with great success.

In an AT type PC it is possible to attach the comm port from the motherboard to the internally mounted  by moving the connector from the pc's back panel or slot cover. This make for a  very neat Emulation setup.

I have added a slightly modified layout to the package that may be a little easier to build as it is a little larger and not so crowded. Take a look at Glitchprog1LedB.brd, the schematic is identical so i did not duplicate it.

This is my first  attempt at releasing a design so pardon my errors. Your comments are appreiciated, I will learn from them.
